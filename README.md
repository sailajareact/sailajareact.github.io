# Memory Game Project
Fun and simple game

## Game Instructions:
The premise of the game is to have a grid of 16 face-down cards. 
The card faces consist of pairs of matches. 
Clicking on cards will flip them over, revealing the value and will start the timer. 
When two are chosen, if it’s a match, both cards will set to face-up with values. 
If it’s not, the cards will flip back over to face-down. 
The game should be different every time the game is refreshed.
Moves will change based on the player either matched or unmatched the cards also,  
timer will start once player click on intial card and score rating will change based move
